<div class="work_history"><strong>High School</strong><p></p>
  <p>During my high school career, I attended Wake Forest High School. Among my classes I participated in the Wake Forest High School Technical Theatre Program. I participated in this program for all but 1 semester of my time at Wake Forest High School. This class taught me beyond the knowledge that regular classes would teach. It even taught beyond itself. While the class was about learning the involvement behind the scenes in a theatrical production, I gained the most out of it's tendency to teach important values about leadership. The class is very student-run. Students are divided into teams (or departments) that are led entirely by a student lead. There are even sub departments within departments so you'll be leading a team at some point through the class. It shows you what you need to do to be able to effectively lead a group of people and gives you a sense of pride when you can see the result of your finished product. Not only did this class teach me leadership and the inter workings of theatrical productions, but it also taught me a lot about the value of hard work. Being able to see your accomplishments in the show at the end makes you feel a sense of pride you (at least I) don't feel too often. To be able to look at a finished set and be able to say... "My work helped make this possible" is an amazing feeling. </p>

I am currently studying at Wake Tech Community College for a major in Computer Sciences. In fact, part of my biggest projects so far has been this portfolio which has been coded using Dreamweaver to manage the HTML and CSS files. Should you have any suggestions, please let me know in the contact page on the Index (Home) page. Please keep in mind that this is my first creation using HTML &amp; CSS and your patience is appreciated, as I am still learning. </div>
