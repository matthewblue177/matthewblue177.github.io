  <p><a class="about_me_title">&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <a class="about_me_body">Hey! My name is Matthew, but you can just call me Matt! I'm a student at Wake Technical Community College and a department leader at Harris Teeter! I have been enroled in Wake Tech Since August of 2022 and I have been working at Harris Teeter since October 2021. I enjoy doing both my studies as well as my job even though sometimes it can be a struggle. It would be a lie if I said I haven't fallen behind in both before. However, I'm determined to make it work! Where theres a will, theres a way! This site was created as my final project for my CTI-110 class and should be a good representation of what that class has taught me. Before it, I couldn't have even started a prohect of this nature, let alone publish it. Should you have any questions, please get in contact with me! I'd love to be of assistance! Thanks!</a></p>
